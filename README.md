This dashboad follows from the work in this research paper [*Understanding Deep Learning for LoS prediction via Latent Space Visualization*](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/693475/articles/683131-understanding-deep-learning-for-los-prediction-via-latent-space-visualization) and conveys the following information:

1.	First, the landing page made up of 2 sections. 
  *a.	The left section: shows the 2D t-SNE projection of the LSTM model latent space. Each marker represents a patient from the test set and the maker’s color and shape is associated with their observed LoS (because it is retrospective data). 
  *b.	The right section: titled ***ID MetaData*** is a table with some demographic and admission information of all test patients. 
2.	Next, one can view the 2D projection of the latent space of 4 other models (GRU, Transformer, TCN, and the TCN-att) both in 2D & 3D. 
3.	Next, using the time slider titled ***Time Steps*** one can view the latent space over time. That is, view the patients’ in the reduced prediction space over time. 
4.	Next, one can click on a patient on the interactive plot and the data of this patient gets highlighted in the table ***ID Metadata***. 
5.	Next, one can click on a specific patient on the Table and this patient gets highlighted on the plot. The highlighted patient can then be monitored over time and in both 2D & 3D dimensions.
6.	Next, one can select a group of patients on the plot and view frequency plots of this group. The frequency plots depend on a user-based feature selection.
